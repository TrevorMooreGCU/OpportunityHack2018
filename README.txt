	The following project is a demonstration of the many talents that span the team 
of five devolopersmentioned above over the course of 33 hours. We were tasked by "Lost 
Our Homes" animal rescue center to build a centralized location to store, move, and analyze 
data regarding the many animals and people involved. The following details are regarding
our solution to the possed problem:

	Our primary focus was a centralized location to store data that was rhobust like
it was built only for "Lost Our Homes" but versatile like it was an open source product.
To accomplish this we created a website which reads in csv files to handle any current
your company might be holding on to all the while allowing you to manually create future
tables preventing the Organization from relying on any other data formating software. 

	The Key behind the sites dynamic data storage is a two table system we designed.
The first tables role is to keep track of column/field names while the second table 
stores the data values that relate to the column names.

	We wanted to push ourselves and begged the question, "why wouldn't people use our 
software?", it came to our attention that some data storage software also offer some 
data analysis functionality. With our minds set on solving as many potential needs as
possible, we set out to find a way to analyze the data we had stored. It was no easy 
feet but we did manage to add a series of google graphs using Javascrypt and designed our
own API to comunicate the tables data between Java and Javascript.

	There are may noteworthy features so In a quick spree I will address a few: the 
ability to export data in the form of a .csv file, Graphs that update and change size 
to meet users needs, Loading wheel, Our unique dashboard that displays tables and grants 
quick access to a table editing feature, and two-step employee authentification as well
as an "employees" view available to admin.

Thanks for this tramendous oppurtunity, we wish all the best for "Lost Our Homes".
